# Bootstrap Wireframe.css
CSS stylesheet to help bootstrap developers elide their project and make it look like a wireframe to avoid discussions on colors while working on layout.

## Compatability

Tested with

* Bootstrap 4.0
* Bootstrap-Vue

## TODO

Would like to add more frameworks.

* Foundation
* Bulma
* Pure.css

## Usage

Simply link wireframe.css after bootstrap.css
